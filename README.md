# G418_readthrough
All code used in analysis of G418 data is available here.

Exact code for generating figures is found in G418_readthrough/figures/figscripts, **Change threadNumb to the desired number of threads, default is 40**

Example figures are found in G418_readthrough/figures/output_figures

Clonning this repository and running Wangen_G418_workflow.py will regenerate the figures from Wangen and Green. 2019. (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/798579v1?rss=1)


### *** WARNING ***
**Running this workflow requires at least 1.1 Terabytes of free storage space to generate all necessary files**

**The pipeline is designed to be run on a computational server with at least 40 threads, and may take an extremely long time to complete if run locally.**

#### Overview of Wangen_G418_workflow.py
1. Generate Genomes
- Download hg38 and Gencode annotations
- Parse the GTF file and choose single isoform for each gene
- Build all other necessary annotation files from parsed GTF
- Parse the GTF file and create a second GTF file that contains all valid transcripts
- Build non codon RNA depletion annotation files
- Build indexes for STAR alignments
2. Raw Sequencing Data
- Download FASTQ files from SRA ***Pending release of data***
- create merged FASTQ files of replicates for select ribosome profiling experiments
3. Ribosome Profiling data processing
- run main analysis pipeline on ribosome profiling data, building all files required for generation of figures
- mapping to all possible transcripts is only performed for select datasets, as this takes a long time
4. RNAseq data processing
- run main analysis pipeline on RNAseq data, building all files required for generation of figures
5. Plot Figures
- Run individual scripts that generate all figures in the manuscript
- Figures can be compared to examples in output_figures to validate successful completion of analysis



#### Description of subfolders: 
- **Data** contains raw luciferase measurments. All raw and processed data files will be saved here
- **figures** contains scripts for generating all figures in *figures/figscripts* and example output figures in *figures/output_figures*
- **genomes** contains currated refseq annotations of rRNA in fasta format. All annotation files will be created in this directory
- **GFF** contains a python module that must be coppied to python2.7/site-packages for import into python. Can also be found here: https://github.com/chapmanb/bcbb/tree/master/gff/BCBio/GFF
- **riboseq** contains scripts for processing ribosome profiling data
- **RNAseq** contains scripts for processing RNAseq data
- **utils** contains scripts for generating annotation files


To run the analysis pipeline, clone the repository and run the **Wangen_G418_workflow.py script**
